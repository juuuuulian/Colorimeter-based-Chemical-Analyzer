# Colorimeter-based-Chemical-Analyzer
 The objective of this project is to build a device capable of handling chemical samples in turret-mounted test tubes, while performing chemical analysis using colorimetry. The project requires use of several peripherals such as Timers, PWM, Interrupts, UART, and Analog sensors on the Tiva TM4C123GH6P microcontroller.
